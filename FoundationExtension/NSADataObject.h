 *  @file
 *  @brief Object containers to handle various concept of data structure.
 *  @details
 *      These classes are designed to pass 2 or 3 objects in compact form, not a verbose NSArray or NSDictionary form.
 *      In these day, there are @[] as short array expression and -: as shotcut of -objectAtIndex:.
 *      These classes may be not very useful. Consider to use above short expressions.
